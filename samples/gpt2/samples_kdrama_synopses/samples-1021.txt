 their endgame of a human rights campaign to stop a notorious rapist from raping a woman's mother.

The original film has an opening narration that recounts the tale of the story of a man and a young girl. One day their quest to stop another tragic fate and make it to the afterlife (by way of a secret entrance) culminates in the battle for their hearts and soul. With their lives hanging in the balance, both men go on a journey together.

Tengah has never been a great writer, his biggest hits being Love Love Love Saffron and Saffron's Last Love Dance, in which he plays four of his famous characters: the love of his life. His most noteworthy works (and no less successful) have yet to appear on the box-office radar. However, due to his high-energy, action-packed scripts and explosive plot, this franchise has never been a failure. Tengah has been nominated for the first time for the Golden Bells Award and been on the list since 2005. The award for best short-film for 2015 was announced during a panel moderated by the legendary screenwriter and director Hwang Woo-young.

Since the film's release in 1987, both Lee Sang-kye (Lee Young-hwa) and his girlfriend Seo Mi-ri (Tae Tae-hwan) share the moment of being hit by a passing car and lose their lives. The love story was shot on location in Seoul's Kwanghaei District; it is set in a Hong Kong-style gaijin (literally Chinese for "little world") called the "Kwanghaei Special Forces Unit" for protecting sensitive targets. Lee Young-hwa was in the police force for five years, earning a lot of credit and being called "the detective of the millennium" by the tabloids. As an officer of the unit, Lee Sang-kye (Song Tae-ri) and Seo Mi-ri (Park So-ri) met, became close, and then both were killed in the line of duty shortly prior to the events in the film.

Lee Sang-kye (Lee Jung-ah) and Kim Young-joo (Kim Bae-joo) were once very good friends. During middle childhood Lee Young-joo was a quiet but sweet young man with no experience in the business. He was the subject of Lee Young-joo's mother's jealous ire, which led to the two losing their best friend in the act of cheating. In the middle of the road, Kim Young-joo was hit and died instantly. A few days later Lee Young-joo's mother was unable to pay the divorce settlement she just made and he died. He was born with his brother in Hong Kong's Kaesol Hospital and grew up at Hojinghoo with his mother.

The following year, the family move to the city of Dongsan (the name of one of Lee Young-joo's favorite places) to work at an office at the Royal Court Palace. The first of many difficulties for the children arises on the eve of their move from a very poor rural village to the new luxury apartment building. Lee Young-joo can't stand being apart, so he takes up photography to make a living. It is then that Lee Young-joo begins to realize that he is not only capable of taking pictures but equally capable of making a living. One day on the front porch, Lee Young-joo falls asleep. When he wakes up the next morning, he finds a young woman asleep, who is looking at him on her iPhone.

The two people who met in their first meeting have grown to trust each other and become extremely close. On the day he meets her, a woman at the Royal Court Palace takes his hand and says he can bring her a dish of white bean curd and she answers Lee Young-joo's phone; after Lee Yong-sook leaves the house the man who brought her the dish says sorry that she cannot answer his phone because the phone service has been hacked. After asking the man to fix the service and giving him the dish, Lee Young-joo and the woman become friends and eventually marry.

The story centers around a man who becomes entangled in his life. The man has no real interest in his past and tries to move forward with the rest of the world. When he gets his information from a third party, the woman, who works as a social worker at a restaurant called Bar Bago-Go (Korean: Bago-Sokkyung) in Bar Bago-Go's parking lot, has a very different understanding of his past and how it has impacted and affected him.

The series follows two families in a drama about a group of young people whose love is to their partners. The story is set in the present day at an apartment complex in Shinjuku, the city famous for its fast-
