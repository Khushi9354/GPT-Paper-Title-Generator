<|startoftext|>And in reality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But if the people we want to be friends with know the truth about our country<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought I would try my best with that film I got<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And Im also very shy to talk about people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought the most important thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Im not a big fan of the word bisexual. Its ridiculous for most guys when you think that. Its funny when you think that Im bisexual - I mean<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought I got a lot more respect from the girls because I was bisexual. It got the recognition it deserved<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had one gay kiss before my marriage. You know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ive never had a relationship with someone like that. And its like<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I think in the movies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Theres been tremendous support from so many people when I was a kid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I grew up on my own and that was very easy for me because I was a kid. I was always on my own where I was comfortable. It was a good time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think we really are stuck after the Iraq war. And even though we knew I was going to be here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Im a very big fan of all kinds. The whole lesbian thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel every single time I do something I look to how many people I have friends with and how many people I know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If anyone could have a relationship with you and you wouldnt like it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was a very awkward night in my marriage. You know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the most difficult things about acting and music is being bisexual. I had this fear of the whole thing. I dont know what it was<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My parents and my grandparents and my parents and all the fans on my Facebook page were all from Texas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ive always admired a woman who has a sexual relationship with the world more than a woman who has a relationship to a woman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was when I was a baby. I had this idea of how a lot of people would react to a baby and how they would think it wasnt a good idea to have sex or have sex or all kinds of things. I thought maybe I would get something bad. But my daughter is beautiful and so beautiful to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Im very positive about what my family and friends are all about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like being around gay men or straight women because I always go home and see more of one of them in the morning than I do in the evening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the music gets boring<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I wouldnt say I have a relationship with a girl of my own. Im not the first girl. Im not the first female. But I respect that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Im not so shy about my sexual fantasies about girls or anything like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got this feeling that we all get so excited when we feel our bodies are getting wet. And I am glad I did. I was really interested in that feeling. But I was so nervous about it at first. I tried a little bit and I was over the moon. And I wasnt. I was just a bit afraid because Im such an old girl and I know this feeling sometimes
