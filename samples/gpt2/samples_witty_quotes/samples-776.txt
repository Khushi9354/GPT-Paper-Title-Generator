<|startoftext|>All I can think of is when Im happy that Im happy and its OK to be unhappy. Thats the real reason I keep moving forward in my life. Thats why I stay in this job<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But for the time being we are all living in a more or less constant constant peace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think its important to have compassion for the kid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is no greater expression of human nature than the word hope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the end<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It was only four months after I hit the majors that I discovered the joy that it takes to live. It takes 10 years for anything. I was able to live my life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had a very healthy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The most beautiful thing about that moment in middle age is that you actually feel it. It was very raw. You feel your life at that moment and then you feel youre really happy at that moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is a sense that this is a life that is not worth doing. This is a lifetime that you want to wait. And you are not going to stop until you make the final decision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was no joy in living that it was not only<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When youre in heaven<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Theres a sense of humor within me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Theres one movie I didnt make<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love the songs. I love the feeling of life. I love the feeling of freedom. You know what I mean? And I think a lot of people think that its just a dream to have<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would rather be in a rock band than in a movie. Thats something I never forget. Theres a lot of pressure to be accepted right now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope that we can make music because it allows people to live a life of their own without the pressure of having to follow through on your ambitions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would be hard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is a moment of quiet regret that appears only briefly in the works of the writer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be honest its hard to remember a moment of happiness you dont remember a single moment of disappointment or frustration you dont remember anything of joy or sadness. The world is so very much alive there is no room for tragedy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didnt want to write anything that was commercial or that would be profitable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think its very important for women actors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was very much into hip-hop and disco and punk. Thats my music now. But to have the time to do the films was amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope to continue not only making these television series but making movies. I hope that Im the same person that I am for the next three or four years. I hope for the right people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What I try to do is try to create something that people can relate to<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I grew up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was very aware of the fact that I am not the most talented guy in the world<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really believe in what we do in sports - and when you watch my games<|endoftext|>
