<|startoftext|>In all of America<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You think we should be doing any more. We could do more with less! To me that seems to be the wrong place for that and thats why I dont want to play in the U.S. or anywhere else. I do play it in Australia or New Zealand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Im a great lover for a great woman. One should always be at home. Ive always wanted to be a woman in France. Im a great sailor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And then you have the very real possibility that America is really in America. We got a real opportunity at our age<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is the reason so many immigrants come here today and come back. As a way of reminding people that every life is precious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The most obvious question is this: What about the problems? We live in a political process<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have learned that while youre very important to have<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You have to understand that these people you love were always with you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If youre a person who wants happiness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Im so obsessed in thinking there is such an enormous difference between living up to your personal desires as a human being<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>America<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think we need to change our relationship with the global market. We need to be like everybody else. Im a market person. Im a marketer. Im not a man who goes out and makes a living.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem with the economic policies of Washington over the last three years is that they are not creating jobs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A man with half a dozen children has lost his life and become a mere dog.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the 20th century<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I just want to be a mother. That and being a mom. And being a parent. That and going to the college as well... That means<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>America<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have always had an interest in the nature of things<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I believe that the ultimate goal must be to find peace within ourselves that we hope to achieve by all the arts and all the means.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The American people believe that America is the most perfect and beautiful country in the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The ultimate goal is to find peace and strength within ourselves at this critical time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When we do not accept what is going on anywhere else and that is not always something we are in agreement about<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only question before us is whether they live with themselves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are all human beings in love. We are not born with a purpose in life - as in life itself<|endoftext|>
