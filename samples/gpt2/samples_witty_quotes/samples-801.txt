<|startoftext|>We are the best educated country in history. We are the only country in history which has failed to provide critical mass for the people who are being deprived. This is the only country in history which has created a system based on the idea that you have to have a certain level of ability to do what you want to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A country that does not have the military might to fight is too weak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where there is enough force to put an armed rebel within a short time of being suppressed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The great development of mankind is not the development of one technology or one country but the development of a vast new intelligence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>War is always carried on by men dressed in the most outrageous costumes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The greatest achievement of a nation lies in the technical ability to fight the enemy without inflicting great wounds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are always dealing with the same problems that have not yet occurred: the same problems we must deal with within ourselves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the United States would be a much better place if we had a different president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>War is the greatest development which is ever lived.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The greatest enemy of the people is not the enemy that wants the people dead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is better to be dead than to be alive. Death makes the latter more beautiful than alive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>War is never ended.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>War does not begin unless and until it has ceased. And I dont think the United States can pretend that our commitment to ending the war was a blank check in World War II.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate war<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Civilization has become a game of chance and the only way to win is for all men to die in an effort to survive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is no such thing as war without bloodshed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every state should take measures to ensure that every individual and every family can live in freedom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>War is not an option for me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wars are not a process<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>War is the last refuge of the scoundrel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>War is the only religion that has to die.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ive never forgotten what I experienced that day in Iraq. I lost a daughter and two sons when we were children. I lost my mother and all my friends. And then I lost my father.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Im willing to die for my values.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>War is the ultimate symbol. It expresses the will of the superior power. It explains the nature of things<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No art can be truly original nor do things appear to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is no surer sign of decay in art than to find a subject to make a city or country stand tall in the midst of incessant war.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have my family and friends in both Germany and Russia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And if in the end<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The war continues in Afghanistan. President Obamas reckless war in Afghanistan has already cost our country millions of dollars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Im still thinking about the American role and the role of the United States. Ive been thinking about the role I might play in an alternative future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have been working with the U.S. and other nations to build capacity<|endoftext|>
