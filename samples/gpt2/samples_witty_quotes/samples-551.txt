 you can be with an English accent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would say that being Jewish is very important. I just dont know why I need to sing. I think thats so important<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was a very open person<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a writer you have an obligation to keep reading and to write. You dont feel it out and you dont look at what you get.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. As a writer I feel it out and I dont try to read things<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Writing is the most important thing in the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It seems to me that this generation is so obsessed with a specific piece of material it is more important to emphasize<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love it in Hollywood. I feel more at home there and in television.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do not want to do anything out of the past<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You must understand the significance of life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a lot of passion in my life and a lot of work to do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the idea that life isnt a matter for your imagination has absolutely no application to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are only three things that can be said in a world that cannot be filled with your finest work: the work of art<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just think its a very good time to get a degree of respect and appreciation and not to be seen as an outcast in the world that way. My mother thinks being attractive and being successful and being part of a large family is kind of like being famous without really achieving any of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The word art comes from an old poem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Im not sure if Im a comic writer or a graphic novelist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even if a person has a job in writing the work makes a lot of the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I feel like being a teenager of 30<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I dont feel like the idea of playing a lead is a thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The one thing I think I have learned as a writer is that I have to write what I see to keep the readers in their head because I need that sense of the world in my head and that I can tell a story that they are into. Thats a huge edge. Being in my own head makes the experience a lot more compelling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel this huge advantage I have over people who are just plain old people. And not being able to stand up and show the same faces for the same money is not that useful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You see<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It should be a part of nature<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What you have - and this is a little bit controversial in itself... the fact that if people see the same things four or five times over the course of years and all of them are the same thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like the movies that are out now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only time you really have to get out of your head is now. Its a terrible time of the year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can see some of this as a time when the music was coming out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A child is one who has been brought up in an almost exclusively English environment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the idea that this could be a long time in the coming that I believe that was a bit of a shock<|endoftext|>
