||startoftext|>My mom and I used to go to the zoo and we would come out all night for a show called My Dad Was a Goliath. I wasnt supposed to do the show for kids. And in an adult setting. She was the only one to have an older sister<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had never even dreamed I was an actress. I was just getting into acting and getting into it and learning and getting into this amazing thing that is a little bit of both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like films with a little bit of a dark undercurrent of humor. I liked films like Dune with its jokes about a dying Indian soldier who gets shot and he falls in love and dies young.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was always funny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was something that made me get a little bit out of sync with people I was seeing. It was the ability to get into the real moods. You never knew where you were going to go next. You had to stay cool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you come home and youre thinking that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was always a little surprised to see that movie. It was such a weird one. It was kind of weird for me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was just playing around and getting into something<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the age of ten I was a full-time actress. I was working on an episode of TV with a big cast. I got my show called The Apprentice. I was doing it for two years. It was such a funny time. People were dying to tell me about my audition. There was talk of my audition for The Apprentice. So I had to go in front of someone - the audition went on. There was talk about how I was supposed to be a full-time actor. I think I would have loved to be such a singer or a dancer. My mother gave me a copy of Joan Didion films - I think they were inspired by a couple of ones in the 60s that I was doing at the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was a teenager in college. My mom had always lived in Texas. I guess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You see movies that portray a certain kind of world in which people dont want to die. So<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did this show. And on a side note<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really respect and enjoy people who do weird things - weird things to do like my mom and dad and everybody<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Theres an amazing balance of being fascinated by human nature and not being afraid to embrace the dark side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My mother was a hippie. She was the first hippy to wear the American flag or something. It was a very hippie aesthetic. You know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a family in Ireland who was a hippy. My parents were hippies - which is how I got my identity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The thing that I grew up around was the attitude towards science that I didnt like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love people who act funny. They really stand out. I would love to do films that were actually funny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My mom had a little bit of a cult mentality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We do the first seven episodes of the new season<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Its definitely kind of a cool look you get when you see movies that dont give that look.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My dad was famous for his films and he was the producer of the first seven Ive made. He was a very cool guy as well. But my dad did a lot of crazy things. I think its all kind of funny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hollywood is like a weird town.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a very loyal relationship with my mom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I believe people
