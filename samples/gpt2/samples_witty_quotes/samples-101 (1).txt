======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 my text. But I think some people get so lost in the music because they can't understand it! And when they hear that they think it is a bad book... I think the music is important because it teaches me that I must be aware of all the problems in an individual. They just do not know that I do when they tell me to watch TV or listen to them play music. And I dont want to be involved with that. All I want to do is create a career and I hope to become a professional dancer or a musician or singer and become a professional musician. That is the purpose of my career. I dont want to get married and have three children or have a family because it would be really difficult for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have some friends who are just musicians - musicians who dont understand the music or the music itself or want to be involved in it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I cannt imagine that I would be interested in music in the future. But I can not imagine that I would need to be involved in music in the future. It would be too expensive to do anything else - because what I would be doing now would be very important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In music<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Music is the ultimate expression of character which we all embody in an individual. Its not always appropriate to express a single concept<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the musician does not enjoy any of his artistic interests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that we all have a musical ideal in our heart, that of being happy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that the biggest difference about jazz and other international jazz musicians is their ability to play the melody of their own music.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is my hope that we are all in the same boat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The real question is this: What do you think of musicians who do not know their music? Because it is not that musicians are necessarily interested in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didnt do anything in particular about the guitar or bass at first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do not see musicians as a form of education.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that when we want to learn music<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think being a musician is not that important as it should be. What you do as a musician is not important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every great writer who ever lived is surrounded by music.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The musician - or musician of the same class - should not be involved in music<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My first step up to music is to be a musical lover<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The more you listen to music<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If a musician has played his music on a violin but that is not his style then he might be interested in other instruments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every day in life we make music and it is easy to make our way into the past.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To me theres nothing wrong with having a good musical career because theres nothing wrong with becoming a professional musician.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If music is a luxury<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think everybody is going to have some kind of music business<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that theres just a certain attitude about music.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People get mad at me every time they learn it - but I wouldnt be bothered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Music is like a circus. It takes its toll on the human heart and mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My father was a musician<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Music has changed the relationship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is no music that I want to hear<|endoftext|>
