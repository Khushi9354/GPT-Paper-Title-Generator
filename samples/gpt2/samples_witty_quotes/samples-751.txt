 is to say there is hope for the better tomorrow by means of which man can work in peace and security and prosperity for all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a lot of faith now that theres some kind of hope in this place. Theres a lot of books<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope is not a gift<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be good people at the moment is as great as anything weve ever imagined. To live the good life is something weve never achieved. And hope was born here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope is an old saying: When you feel that something isnt working<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never assume that someone else has the answer to your problem! You must also know that we are all here for something<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For if youre able to find the purpose of your life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I couldnt care less if Im a success or a failure. If I had<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our most ancient and most important dream is to be a nation strong and free: and for that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had the good fortune of meeting and being informed about the great leaders of the world<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That would be very good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope that the most important people on earth will be the people who can be trusted to tell the truth about the extent of government tyranny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We must get more people to work together<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As Christians<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My hope is that the next four or five years will bring many good things for Israel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Im thankful to God for what he gave me for my own future and life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We should always have a hope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You have to love more than you love<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you come to terms with your fears<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that if youre going to have a career that people want to make and then they believe in you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need to learn to love ourselves and share a heart that is big enough to love God and be faithful to God<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Im very hopeful about this new world - where theres no government and all of our citizens have every right to organize and vote and tell the truth about what we want. But we also know that there are other peoples lives on the line<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The good news is that our leaders will finally tell Americans you love him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Im not a fan of saying something as trivial as you always should<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope that people can enjoy all the good movies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Theres nothing wrong with seeing what has been done. I think you always should think the other way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God does not judge of our deeds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What God wants is justice and peace. Thats what I hope - and I hope - to be true. Until then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But Im sure Ive been very fortunate not<|endoftext|>
