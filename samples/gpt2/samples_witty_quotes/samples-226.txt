======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 for many years because I know where my best friend was - at school.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it was my lack of a passion that kept me from making movies that would be really original<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Im a huge fan of my parents<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love doing a film that is original.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My dad was a big supporter of the Vietnam War and a huge supporter of the Vietnam Veterans Rights Program and the Veterans Employment Program<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ive never thought very much about my dad getting divorced or his involvement in politics or anything like that. If my mother was there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I dont think its even about me. Ive always felt Ive worked hard to make movies based on what I believe is best for women and girls that I know have made a movie that I respect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My mom has always been a great influence on me. She pushed me to be a star. I think that had a lot to do with my dad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just wanted to do one hell of a movie. I felt like there are a lot of great movies that could be made for kids<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My dad worked hard in his career because he was the head of my family and he saw the need that made it worthwhile for me to pursue my dream of becoming an actor. So I turned to him as inspiration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every time I see a story of my dad I think<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love being a kid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was the only one in my family who wanted to play a certain man. My father was a huge football fan. His work ethic put the pressure on my shoulders. I remember my dad screaming at the top of my lungs. I never understood that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My dad just got sick. He passed away suddenly. He never spoke to me again. I have this family of very humble people that have been blessed with great things that happened in the family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We got married in 1978<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My parents were very strict. They had a strict upbringing and my family felt a lot like a kind of home or a sort of safe place. It was very tight-knit. It was just the fact that I was an English parent that made me feel safe and safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Its amazing to see films that were really good and not just made on budget for a small group<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Growing up in Washington D.C. was a very tight-knit school. Our classes were very supportive. The biggest element was making sure our students had an enjoyable education and the hard work that went into that was very worthwhile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Music<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I dont think Ive ever heard an origin story of what it was like being back in the 70s and 80s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know that Im a lesbian<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lot of the great roles in Hollywood were actually because the script worked. But the original vision and its original cast and all of its amazing actors came along.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I never knew a character so special and so exciting that had to happen because Id gone to that movie that wasnt actually going to work. It meant I got to work on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I believe that being a parent is the big change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Im at work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lot of people who are gay are scared to be in movies and have to tell friends and they cant do it alone it wasnt necessary. Its really good people talking about it. I wasnt always that kind of gay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If there was an artist<|endoftext|
