<|startoftext|>What makes a good movie? You know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People are willing to die for your movies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I dont know why people watch me. I love the movies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I dont like the idea of making movies. I dont do that much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you are able to give your audience the movies that youre doing really well that youre giving them something that would be really good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do people say films dont really exist? Why does every single film have to be an influence?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can imagine the kind of movies I could produce<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Theres nothing wrong with me being a bad guy. I dont know it but its pretty difficult: I try to play a very high-profile figure as much as I can<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You dont feel like youre making good movies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think theyre trying to bring in younger readers who need to stay inside. That kind of shows. It might be easier for older people to go through and see me. They might read something more. Maybe have a good book on that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I started my new company<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The movies I am getting right now have an edge. I enjoy them. If they feel that way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It depends on the movie. I think people in this town are sick of watching good movies. Those who read the newspaper really want me to stay in their communities. So I look at it as a choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel a lot of the excitement that I had was fueled by the movies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My son and I were really friends and it was a great time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I did have my moments of a lack of movie experience if I had been an older guy growing up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was very much in the movie business at that time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every great director has made a bad movie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ive done movies that are so scary and horror-laden and that is just hard to get people to read. Its like the first time you see a bad movie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The best part is you know that Id never felt comfortable doing film.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are not in a state where there are any movies. Thats a shame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am in an extremely bad film.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wanted to go on a journey. I wanted to experience life as a writer. Its a strange experience<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think Im really happy with the business I have now. I get movies every day and I want them to bring me joy and bring me joy from this business because I dont have to do anything the everyday way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You see it most with those old movies when youre young or you have an amazing career or youre not very creative or youve been a producer or you like movies or you like acting... Its like its all been made<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some people think Im funny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Id like to be on a musical. I dont want to be sad or sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Its true that I dont like anything about all of those movies. Maybe its because I have so much experience and I watch all of them. But if youre a serious movie guy<|endoftext|>
